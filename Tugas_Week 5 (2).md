### Timeline of Operating Systems: From Early Systems to Modern OS

Below is a timeline of the evolution of operating systems from their inception to the present day, highlighting key operating systems and innovations that have shaped the world of computing:

---

#### **1940s: The Dawn of Computing**
- **1949: Manchester Mark 1**  
  - The first computer to use the **stored program** concept.  
  - Did not have a modern operating system but laid the foundation for OS development.

---

#### **1950s: Batch Processing and Early Operating Systems**
- **1951: Ferranti Mark 1**  
  - The first commercial computer, still operated manually without a modern operating system.  
- **1956: GM-NAA I/O**  
  - The first operating system used for the IBM 704, automating input/output operations.  
- **1957: FORTRAN Monitor System (FMS)**  
  - An early operating system designed to run FORTRAN programs.

---

#### **1960s: Time-Sharing and Multiprogramming**
- **1961: CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System)**  
  - The first time-sharing system developed at MIT, allowing multiple users to use a computer simultaneously.  
- **1962: Atlas Supervisor**  
  - The first operating system to use **virtual memory** and **demand paging**.  
- **1965: MULTICS**  
  - Developed by MIT, GE, and Bell Labs, MULTICS introduced the concept of a time-sharing operating system with segmented and paged memory management.  
  - Became the foundation for UNIX.  
- **1969: UNIX**  
  - Developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, UNIX became a highly influential operating system with its modular design and portability.

#### **1970s: Minicomputers and Personal Computing**
- **1970: CP/M (Control Program/Monitor)**  
  - An operating system for 8-bit microcomputers, becoming the standard for early personal computers.  
- **1973: Xerox Alto**  
  - The first computer with a graphical user interface (GUI), though not a commercial operating system.  
- **1977: Apple DOS**  
  - The operating system for the Apple II, one of the first commercially successful personal computers.  
- **1978: VMS (Virtual Memory System)**  
  - Developed by DEC for VAX computers, supporting virtual memory and multitasking.

#### **1980s: The GUI Era and Personal Computing**
- **1981: MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)**  
  - The operating system for IBM PCs, becoming the standard for x86-based personal computers.  
- **1984: Macintosh System 1**  
  - The first operating system with a GUI for the Macintosh, revolutionizing how users interacted with computers.  
- **1985: Windows 1.0**  
  - The first version of Microsoft Windows, offering a GUI-based environment on top of MS-DOS.  
- **1987: OS/2**  
  - Developed by IBM and Microsoft, OS/2 was designed to replace MS-DOS but did not achieve the expected popularity.

#### **1990s: Windows Dominance and the Rise of Open Source**
- **1991: Linux**  
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds, Linux is an open-source operating system based on the UNIX kernel.  
  - Became the foundation for many Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.  
- **1993: Windows NT**  
  - A modern operating system from Microsoft with a 32-bit architecture, supporting multitasking and multiuser capabilities.  
- **1995: Windows 95**  
  - Microsoft's first operating system with a more user-friendly GUI, introducing the Start menu and taskbar.  
- **1997: Mac OS 8**  
  - The latest version of Apple's operating system before transitioning to Mac OS X.

---

#### **2000s: Modernization and Mobile Computing**
- **2001: Mac OS X**  
  - Apple's UNIX-based operating system with a modern GUI (Aqua), replacing the classic Mac OS.  
- **2001: Windows XP**  
  - A highly popular Microsoft operating system, combining the stability of Windows NT with the ease of use of Windows 95/98.  
- **2007: iOS**  
  - Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone, transforming the smartphone industry with its touch interface and App Store.  
- **2008: Android**  
  - A Linux-based mobile operating system developed by Google, becoming the main competitor to iOS.

#### **2010s: Cloud Computing and Modern Operating Systems**
- **2012: Windows 8**  
  - Microsoft's operating system with the Modern UI (Metro) interface, designed for touchscreens.  
- **2015: Windows 10**  
  - Microsoft's operating system combining elements of Windows 7 and 8, with support for hybrid devices and cloud computing.  
- **2015: macOS (formerly OS X)**  
  - Apple rebranded OS X as macOS, focusing on integration with iOS devices.  
- **2017: Android Oreo**  
  - The latest version of Android with features like Picture-in-Picture and support for IoT devices.
